## What Spotify Backstage is:
### IDP:
An Internal Developer Portal is a portal that helps developers make sense of their engineering ecosystem.  
Spotify Backstage provides a centralized place to look up information about their tooling, services and architecture.  
It allows developers to understand what other teams are working on and how their environments are running.  
It can be thought of as a single pane of glass, or a hub for software development.  

A service catalog, or software catalog, is a list of all of the internal software assets available inside a company.  
In Backstage, this can include services, systems, resources such as S3 buckets, and other concepts.  
It also includes groups of humans, who can own software in the Catalog.  
The Catalog allows users to “look up” internal systems to find information about them.  

On a technical level, Spotify Backstage is a collection of TypeScript libraries which can be combined together  
to create a Developer Portal. The Developer Portal is typically organized and centered around a service catalog.

### Problems tackled by Spotify Backstage:
Backstage helps to solve a number of different problems. They fall broadly into two categories: discoverability and governance.  
#### Discoverability --> Backstage solves this problem by collecting software, tools, teams, people and other assets into one place  
where they can be easily searched and organized.  

#### Opaque software ownership  
The first step towards effective collaboration and InnerSourcing is to be able to easily understand who owns what.  
Backstage addresses this problem by tracking teams and software assets, and making it easy to create a clear linkage between them.  

### The main features of Backstage by Spotify  
Backstage is fundamentally a flexible, plugin based system, which can be modified to suit your use case and the internal  
tools you already love. It’s designed to integrate with existing systems, rather than replacing them.
